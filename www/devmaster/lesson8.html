<h3>An Introduction to OggVorbis</h3>



<p>Ever heard of Ogg? There's more to it than a funny sounding name. It's the 
biggest thing to happen for audio compression since mp3's (also typically used 
for music). Hopefully, one day, it will replace mp3's as the mainstream standard 
for compressed audio. Is it better than mp3? That is a question that is a little 
more difficult to answer. It's a pretty strong debate in some crowds. There are 
various arguments about compression ratio vs. sound quality which can sometimes 
get really cumbersome to read through. I personally don't have any opinion on 
which is "better". I feel the evidence in either case is arguable and not worth 
mentioning. But for me the fact that Ogg is royalty free (which mp3 is not) wins 
the argument hands down. The mp3 licensing fee is by no means steep for 
developers with deep pockets, but as an independent working on a project in your 
spare time and on minimal resources, shelling out a few grand in fees is not an 
option. Ogg may be the answer to your prayers.</p>



<h3>Designing Your OggVorbis Streaming API</h3>


<p>Without further ado let's get to some code.</p>


<p>This tutorial will be written in Java and has two main classes: 
<a href="https://joal-demos.dev.java.net/source/browse/joal-demos/src/java/demos/devmaster/lesson8/OggDecoder.java?view=markup"><var>OggDecoder</var></a> and
<a href="https://joal-demos.dev.java.net/source/browse/joal-demos/src/java/demos/devmaster/lesson8/OggStreamer.java?view=markup"><var>OggStreamer</var></a>. The
<var>OggDecoder</var> class is wrapper on the <a href="http://www.j-ogg.de">J-Ogg</a> library to decode an Ogg/Vorbis stream and will not be described in this
tutorial. <var>OggStreamer</var> which is the main class doing most of the working for streaming using OpenAL is explained below.

</p>

<pre class="code">
    // The size of a chunk from the stream that we want to read for each update.
    private static int BUFFER_SIZE = 4096*8;

    // The number of buffers used in the audio pipeline
    private static int NUM_BUFFERS = 2;
</pre>



<p>'<var>BUFFER_SIZE</var>' defines how big a chunk we want 
to read from the stream on each update. You will find (with a little 
experimentation) that larger buffers usually produce better sound quality since 
they don't update as often, and will generally avoid any abrupt pauses or sound 
distortions. Of course making your buffer too big will also eat up more memory. 
Making a stream redundant. I beleive 4096 is the minimum buffer size one can 
have. I don't recommend using one that small. I tried, and it caused many 
clicks.</p>


<p>So why should we even bother with streaming? Why not load the whole file into 
a buffer and then play it? Well, that is a good question. The quick answer is 
that there is too much audio data. Even though the actual Ogg file size is quite 
small (usually around 1-3 MB) you must remember that is compressed audio data. 
You cannot play the compressed form of the data. It must be decompressed and 
formatted into a form OpenAL recognizes before it can be used in a buffer. That 
is why we stream the file.</p>



<pre class="code">    /**<br>     * The main loop to initialize and play the entire stream<br>     */<br>    public boolean playstream() { ... }<br><br>    /**<br>     * Open the Ogg/Vorbis stream and initialize OpenAL based<br>     * on the stream properties<br>     */<br>    public boolean open() { ... }<br><br>    /**<br>     * OpenAL cleanup<br>     */<br>    public void release() { ... }<br><br>    /**<br>     * Play the Ogg stream<br>     */<br>    public boolean playback() { ... }<br><br>    /**<br>     * Check if the source is playing<br>     */<br>    public boolean playing() { ... }<br><br>    /**<br>     * Update the stream if necessary<br>     */<br>    public boolean update() { ... }<br><br>    /**<br>     * Reloads a buffer (reads in the next chunk)<br>     */<br>    public boolean stream(int buffer) { ... }<br><br>    /**<br>     * Empties the queue<br>     */<br>    protected void empty() { ... }<br></pre>



<p>This will be the base of our Ogg streaming api. The public methods are 
everything that one needs to actually get the Ogg to play. Protected methods are 
more internal procedures. I won't go over each function 
just yet. I believe my comments should give you an idea of what they're for.</p>



<pre class="code">
    // Buffers hold sound data. There are two of them by default (front/back)
    private int[] buffers = new int[NUM_BUFFERS];
    
    // Sources are points emitting sound.
    private int[] source = new int[1];
</pre>


<p>First thing that I want to point out is that we have 2 buffers dedicated to 
the stream rather than the 1 we have always used for wav files. This is 
important. To understand this I want you to think about how double buffering 
works in OpenGL/DirectX. There is a front buffer that is "on screen" at any 
given second, while a back buffer is being drawn to. Then they are swapped. The 
back buffer becomes the front and vice versa. Pretty much the same principle is 
applied here. There is a buffer being played and one waiting to be played. When 
the buffer being played has finished the next one starts. While the next buffer 
is being played, the first one is refilled with a new chunk of data from the 
stream and is set to play once the one playing is finished. Confused yet? I'll 
explain this in more detail later on.</p>



<pre class="code">    public boolean open() {<br>	oggDecoder = new OggDecoder(url);<br><br>        if (!oggDecoder.initialize()) {<br>            System.err.println("Error initializing ogg stream...");<br>            return false;<br>        }<br>        <br>        if (oggDecoder.numChannels() == 1)<br>	    format = AL.AL_FORMAT_MONO16;<br>	else<br>	    format = AL.AL_FORMAT_STEREO16;<br>        <br>	rate = oggDecoder.sampleRate();<br><br>	...<br>    }<br></pre>



<p>This creates a decoder for Ogg file, initializes it and grabs some information on the file. We extract the OpenAL format 
enumerator based on how many channels are in the Ogg and then make a not of the sample rate.</p>



<pre class="code">    public boolean open() {<br>	...<br><br>        al.alGenBuffers(NUM_BUFFERS, buffers, 0); check();<br>        al.alGenSources(1, source, 0); check();<br><br>	al.alSourcefv(source[0], AL.AL_POSITION , sourcePos, 0);<br>	al.alSourcefv(source[0], AL.AL_VELOCITY , sourceVel, 0);<br>	al.alSourcefv(source[0], AL.AL_DIRECTION, sourceDir, 0);<br>        <br>        al.alSourcef(source[0], AL.AL_ROLLOFF_FACTOR,  0.0f    );<br>        al.alSourcei(source[0], AL.AL_SOURCE_RELATIVE, AL.AL_TRUE);<br><br>	...<br>    }<br></pre>



<p>You've seen most of this before. We set a bunch of default values, position, 
velocity, direction... But what is rolloff factor? This has to do with 
attenuation. I will cover attenuation in a later article so I won't go too 
in-depth, but I will explain it basically. Rolloff factor judges the strength of 
attenuation over distance. By setting it to 0 we will have turned it off. This 
means that no matter how far away the Listener is to the source of the Ogg they 
will still hear it. The same idea applies to source relativity.</p>



<pre class="code">
    public void release() {
	al.alSourceStop(source[0]);
	empty();

	for (int i = 0; i < NUM_BUFFERS; i++) {
	    al.alDeleteSources(i, source, 0); check();
	}
    }
</pre>


<p>We can clean up after ourselves using this. We stop the source, empty out any 
buffers that are still in the queue, and destroy our objects.

</p>

<pre class="code">
    public boolean playback() {
	if (playing())
	    return true;
        
	for (int i = 0; i < NUM_BUFFERS; i++) {
	    if (!stream(buffers[i]))
		return false;
	}
    
	al.alSourceQueueBuffers(source[0], NUM_BUFFERS, buffers, 0);
	al.alSourcePlay(source[0]);
    
        return true;
    }
</pre>



<p>This will start playing the Ogg. If the Ogg is already playing then there is 
no reason to do it again. We must also initialize the buffers with their first 
data set. We then queue them and tell the source to play them. This is the first 
time we have used '<var>alSourceQueueBuffers</var>'. What it does basically is give the 
source multiple buffers. These buffers will be played sequentially. I will 
explain more on this along with the source queue momentarily. One thing to make 
a note of though: if you are using a source for streaming never bind a buffer to 
it using '<var>alSourcei</var>'. Always use '<var>alSourceQueueBuffers</var>' consistently.</p>



<pre class="code">    public boolean playing() {<br>	int[] state = new int[1];<br>    <br>	al.alGetSourcei(source[0], AL.AL_SOURCE_STATE, state, 0);<br>    <br>	return (state[0] == AL.AL_PLAYING);<br>    }<br></pre>


<p>This simplifies the task of checking the state of the source. </p>



<pre class="code">    public boolean update() {<br>	int[] processed = new int[1];<br>	boolean active = true;<br><br>	al.alGetSourcei(source[0], AL.AL_BUFFERS_PROCESSED, processed, 0);<br><br>	while (processed[0] &gt; 0)<br>	{<br>	    int[] buffer = new int[1];<br>	    <br>	    al.alSourceUnqueueBuffers(source[0], 1, buffer, 0); check();<br><br>	    active = stream(buffer[0]);<br><br>	    al.alSourceQueueBuffers(source[0], 1, buffer, 0); check();<br><br>	    processed[0]--;<br>	}<br><br>	return active;<br>    }<br></pre>


<p>Here is how the queue works in a nutshell: There is a 'list' of buffers. When 
you unqueue a buffer it gets popped off of the front. When you queue a buffer it 
gets pushed to the back. That's it. Simple enough?</p>


<p>This is 1 of the 2 most important methods in the class. What we do in this 
bit of code is check if any buffers have already been played. If there is then 
we start popping each of them off the back of the queue, we refill the buffers 
with data from the stream, and then we push them back onto the queue so that 
they can be played. Hopefully the Listener will have no idea that we have done 
this. It should sound like one long continuous chain of music. The '<var>stream</var>' 
function also tells us if the stream is finished playing. This flag is reported 
back when the function returns.</p>



<pre class="code">    public boolean stream(int buffer) {<br>	byte[] pcm = new byte[BUFFER_SIZE];<br>	int    size = 0;<br><br>	try {<br>	    if ((size = oggDecoder.read(pcm)) &lt;= 0)<br>		return false;<br>	} catch (Exception e) {<br>	    e.printStackTrace();<br>	    return false;<br>	}<br><br>	ByteBuffer data = ByteBuffer.wrap(pcm, 0, size);<br>	al.alBufferData(buffer, format, data, size, rate);<br>	check();<br>	<br>	return true;<br>    }<br></pre>


<p>This is another important method of the class. This part fills the buffers 
with data from the Ogg bitstream. It's a little harder to get a grip on because 
it's not explainable in a top down manner. '<var>oggDecoder.read</var>' does exactly what you may 
be thinking it does; it reads data from the Ogg bitstream. The <a href="http://www.j-ogg.de/">j-ogg</a> library does all 
the decoding of the bitstream, so we don't have to worry about that. This 
function takes a <var>byte</var> array as an argument and will decode atmost the capacity of
this array.  </p>


<p>The return value of '<var>oggDecoder.read</var>' indicates several things. If the value of the 
result is positive then it represents how much data was read. This is important 
because '<var>read</var>' may not be able to read the entire size requested (usually 
because it's at the end of the file and there's nothing left to read). Use the 
result of '<var>read</var>' over '<var>BUFFER_SIZE</var>' in any case. If the result of '<var>read</var>' 
happens to be negative then it indicates that there was an error in the 
bitstream. If the result happens to equal zero then there is nothing left in the file to play.</p>



<p> The last part of this method is the call to '<var>alBufferData</var>' 
which fills the buffer id with the data that we streamed from the Ogg using '<var>read</var>'. 
We employ the '<var>format</var>' and '<var>rate</var>' values that we set up earlier</p>



<pre class="code">    protected void empty() {<br>	int[] queued = new int[1];<br>	<br>	al.alGetSourcei(source[0], AL.AL_BUFFERS_QUEUED, queued, 0);<br>	<br>	while (queued[0] &gt; 0)<br>	{<br>	    int[] buffer = new int[1];<br>	<br>	    al.alSourceUnqueueBuffers(source[0], 1, buffer, 0);<br>	    check();<br><br>	    queued[0]--;<br>	}<br><br>	oggDecoder = null;<br>    }<br></pre>


<p>This method will will unqueue any buffers that are pending on the source. </p>



<pre class="code">    protected void check() {<br>        if (al.alGetError() != AL.AL_NO_ERROR)<br>            throw new ALException("OpenAL error raised...");<br>    }<br></pre>


<p>This saves us some typing for our error checks.</p>



<h3>Making Your Own OggVorbis Player</h3>


<p>If you're with me so far then you must be pretty serious about getting this 
to work for you. Don't worry! We are almost done. All that we need do now is use 
our newly designed class to play an Ogg file. It should be a relatively simple 
process from here on in. We have done the hardest part. I won't assume that you 
will be using this in a game loop, but I'll keep it in mind when designing the 
loop. </p>

<p>This should be a no-brainer. </p>


<pre class="code">
    public boolean playstream() {
        if (!open())
            return false;
        
        oggDecoder.dump();
        
        if (!playback())
            return false;
        
        while (update()) {
            if (playing()) continue;
            
            if (!playback())
                return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
</pre>

<p>The program opens the stream, dumps some stream information and then
will continually loop as long as the '<var>update</var>' method continues to 
return true, and it will continue to return true as long as it can successfully 
read and play the audio stream. Within the loop we will make sure that the Ogg 
is playing.</p>

<h3>Answers To Questions You May Be Asking</h3>


<h4>Can I use more than one buffer for the stream?</h4>


<p>In short, yes. There can be any number of buffers queued on the source at a 
time. Doing this may actually give you better results too. As I said earlier, 
with just 2 buffers in the queue at any time and with the cpu being clocked out 
(or if the system hangs), the source may actually finish playing before the 
stream has decoded another chunk. Having 3 or even 4 buffers in the queue will 
keep you a little further ahead in case you miss the update.</p>


<h4>How often should I call ogg.update?</h4>


<p>This is going to vary depending on several things. If you want a quick answer 
I'll tell you to update as often as you can, but that is not really necessary. 
As long as you update before the source finishes playing to the end of the 
queue. The biggest factors that are going to affect this are the buffer size and 
the number of buffers dedicated to the queue. Obviously if you have more data 
ready to play to begin with less updates will be necessary.</p>


<h4>Is it safe to stream more than one Ogg at a time?</h4>


<p>It should be fine. I haven't performed any extreme testing but I don't see 
why not. Generally you will not have that many streams anyway. You may have one 
to play some background music, and the occasional character dialog for a game, 
but most sound effects are too short to bother with streaming. Most of your 
sources will only ever have one buffer attached to them.</p>


<h4>So what is with the name?</h4>


<p>"Ogg" is the name of Xiph.org's container format for audio, video, and 
metadata. "Vorbis" is the name of a specific audio compression scheme that's 
designed to be contained in Ogg. As for the specific meanings of the words... 
well, that's a little harder to tell. I think they involve some strange 
relationship to Terry Pratchett novels. Here is a little page that goes into the 
details.</p>
