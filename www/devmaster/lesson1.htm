  <p>Welcome to the exciting world of OpenAL! OpenAL 
is still in a stage of growth, and even though there is an ever larger following 
to the API it still hasn't reached it's full potential. One of the big reasons 
for this is that there is still not yet hardware acceleration built in for 
specific cards. However, Creative Labs is a major contributor to the OpenAL 
project and also happens to be one of the largest soundcard manufacturers. So 
there is a promise of hardware accelerated features in the near future. OpenAL's 
only other major contributor, Loki, has gone the way of the dinosaur. So the 
future of OpenAL on Linux platforms is uncertain. You can still obtain the Linux 
binaries on some more obscure websites.</p>
<p>OpenAL has also not been seen in many major 
commercial products, which may have also hurt it's growth. As far as I know the 
only pc game to use OpenAL has been Metal Gear 2 (although recently I've 
discovered that Unreal 2 does as well). The popular modeling program, Blender3D, 
was also known to use OpenAL for all it's audio playback. Aside from these 
however the only other OpenAL uses have been in the sdk examples and a few 
obscure tutorials on the internet.</p>
<p>But lets face it, OpenAL has a lot of 
potential. There are many other audio libraries that claim to work with the 
hardware on a lower level (and this may be true), but the designers of OpenAL 
did several things in it's design which make it a superior API. First of all 
they emulated the OpenGL API which is one of the best ever designed. The API 
style is flexible, so different coding methods and hardware implementations will 
take advantage of this. People who have had a lot of experience with OpenGL will 
be able to pick up OpenAL quite fast. OpenAL also has the advantage of creating 
3D surround sound which a lot of other API's cannot boast. On top of all of that 
it also has the ability to extend itself into EAX and AC3 flawlessly. To my 
knowledge no other audio library has that capability.</p>
<p>If you still haven't found a reason here to use 
OpenAL then here's another. It's just cool. It's a nice looking API and will 
integrate well into your code. You will be able to do many cool sound effects 
with it. But before we do that we have to learn the basics.</p>

<p>So let's get coding!</p>
<pre class=code><font color="#0000FF">import</font> net.java.games.joal.*;
<font color="#0000FF">import</font> net.java.games.joal.util.*;
<font color="#0000FF">import</font> java.io.*;
<font color="#0000FF">import</font> java.nio.ByteBuffer;</pre>
<pre class=code><font color="#0000FF">public</font> <font color="#0000FF">class</font> SingleStaticSource {

	<font color="#0000FF"><span class=codeComment>static</span></font><span class=codeComment> AL al = ALFactory.getAL();

	<font color="#006600">// Buffers hold sound data.</font></span>
	<font color="#0000FF">static int</font>[] buffer = new <font color="#0000FF">int</font>[1];;

<span class=codeComment>	<font color="#006600">// Sources are points emitting sound.</font></span>
	<font color="#0000FF">static int</font>[] source = <font color="#0000FF">new</font> <font color="#0000FF">int</font>[1];
</pre>
<p>Those familiar with OpenGL know that it uses &quot;texture objects&quot; (or &quot;texture 
names&quot;) to handle textures used by a program. OpenAL does a similar thing with 
audio samples. There are essentially 3 kinds of objects in OpenAL. A buffer 
which stores all the information about how a sound should be played and the 
sound data itself, and a source which is a point in space that emits a sound. 
It's important to understand that a source is not itself an audio sample. A 
source only plays back sound data from a buffer bound to it. The source is also 
given special properties like position and velocity. </p>
<p>The third object which I have not mentioned yet is the listener. There is 
only one listener which represents where 'you' are, the user. The listener 
properties along with the source properties determine how the audio sample will 
be heard. For example their relative positions will determine the intensity of 
the sound.</p>

<pre class=code>	
<span class=codeComment><font color="#006600">	// Position of the source sound.</font></span>
<font color="#0000FF">	static float</font>[] sourcePos = { 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f };
<font color="#006600">
<span class=codeComment>	// Velocity of the source sound.</span></font>
<font color="#0000FF">	static float</font>[] sourceVel = { 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f };

<span class=codeComment>	<font color="#006600">// Position of the listener.</font></span>
	<font color="#0000FF">static float</font>[] listenerPos = { 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f };

<span class=codeComment>	<font color="#006600">// Velocity of the listener.</font></span>
	<font color="#0000FF">static float</font>[] listenerVel = { 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f };

<span class=codeComment>	<font color="#006600">// Orientation of the listener. (first 3 elements are "at", second 3 are "up")</font></span>
	<font color="#0000FF">static float</font>[] listenerOri = { 0.0f, 0.0f, -1.0f,  0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f };
</pre>

<p>In the above code we specify the position and velocity of the source and listener 
  objects. These arrays are vector based Cartesian coordinates. You could easily 
  build a structure or class to do the same thing. In this example I used arrays 
  for simplicity.</p>
<p>Here we will create a function that loads all of our sound data from a file. 
</p>
<pre class=code>	<font color="#0000FF">static int</font> LoadALData() {

<span class=codeComment>	 	<font color="#006600">// variables to load into</font>
   
	 	<font color="#0000FF">int</font>[] format = <font color="#0000FF">new int</font>[1];<br>    	<font color="#0000FF">int</font>[] size = <font color="#0000FF">new int</font>[1];<br>    	ByteBuffer[] data = <font color="#0000FF">new</font> ByteBuffer[1];<br>    	<font color="#0000FF">int</font>[] freq = new <font color="#0000FF">int</font>[1];
	 	<font color="#0000FF">int</font>[] loop = new <font color="#0000FF">int</font>[1];<br></span>
    	<font color="#006600">// Load wav data into a buffer.</font>
		al.alGenBuffers(1, buffer);
    	<span class=codeKeyword>if</span> (al.alGetError() != AL.AL_NO_ERROR)
        <span class=codeKeyword>	return</span> AL.AL_FALSE;

	 	ALut.alutLoadWAVFile(&quot;wavdata/FancyPants.wav&quot;, format, data, size, freq, loop);
    	al.alBufferData(buffer[0], format[0], data[0], size[0], freq[0]);
	 	ALut.alutUnloadWAV(format[0],data[0],size[0],freq[0]); 
</pre>
<p>The function 'alGenBuffers' will create the buffer objects and store them in 
the variable we passed it. It's important to do an error check to make sure 
everything went smoothly. There may be a case in which OpenAL could not generate 
a buffer object due to a lack of memory. In this case it would set the error 
bit.</p>
<p>The ALut is very helpful here. It opens up the file for us and gives us all 
  the information we need to create the buffer. And after we have attached all 
  this data to the buffer it will help use dispose of the data. It all works in 
  a clean and efficient manner.</p>
<pre class=code>
    <span class=codeComment><font color="#006600">// Bind buffer with a source.</font></span>
    al.alGenSources(1, source);

    <span class=codeKeyword>if</span> (al.alGetError() != AL.AL_NO_ERROR)
        <span class=codeKeyword>return</span> AL.AL_FALSE;

    al.alSourcei (source[0], AL.AL_BUFFER,   buffer[0]   );
    al.alSourcef (source[0], AL.AL_PITCH,    1.0f     );
    al.alSourcef (source[0], AL.AL_GAIN,     1.0f     );
    al.alSourcefv(source[0], AL.AL_POSITION, sourcePos);
    al.alSourcefv(source[0], AL.AL_VELOCITY, sourceVel);
    al.alSourcei (source[0], AL.AL_LOOPING,  loop[0]     );</pre>
<p>We generate a source object in the same manner we generated the buffer object. 
Then we define the source properties that it will use when it's in playback. The 
most important of these properties is the buffer it should use. This tells the 
source which audio sample to playback. In this case we only have one so we bind 
it. We also tell the source it's position and velocity which we defined earlier.</p>
<p>One more thing on 'alGenBuffers' and 'alGenSources'. In some example code I 
have seen these functions will return an integer value for the number of 
buffers/sources created. I suppose this was meant as an error checking feature 
that was left out in a later version. If you see this done in other code don't 
use it yourself. If you want to do this check, use 'alGetError' instead (like we 
have done above).</p>
<pre class=code>
    <span class=codeComment><font color="#006600">// Do another error check and return.</font></span>
    <span class=codeKeyword><font color="#0000FF">if</font></span> (al.alGetError() == AL.AL_NO_ERROR)
        <span class=codeKeyword><font color="#0000FF">return</font></span> AL.AL_TRUE;

    <span class=codeKeyword><font color="#0000FF">return</font></span> AL.AL_FALSE;
}
</pre>
<p>To end the function we just do one more check to make sure all is well, then 
we return success.</p>
<pre class=code><font color="#0000FF">static <span class=codeKeyword>void</span> </font>setListenerValues() {
    al.alListenerfv(AL.AL_POSITION,	listenerPos);
    al.alListenerfv(AL.AL_VELOCITY,    listenerVel);
    al.alListenerfv(AL.AL_ORIENTATION, listenerOri);
}
</pre>
<p>We created this function to update the listener properties.</p>
<pre class=code><font color="#0000FF">static <span class=codeKeyword>void</span> </font>killALData() {
    al.alDeleteBuffers(1, buffer);
    al.alDeleteSources(1, source);
	 Alut.alutExit();
}
</pre>

<p>This will be our shutdown procedure. It is necessary to call this to release 
all the memory and audio devices that our program may be using.</p>
<pre class=code><font color="#0000FF">public static void main</font>(<span class=codeKeyword>String[] args</span>) {
    <span class=codeComment><font color="#006600">// Initialize OpenAL and clear the error bit.</font></span>
<span class=codeComment>
	ALut.alutInit();</span>
   al.alGetError();

</pre>
<p>The function 'alutInit' will setup everything that the Alc needs to do for 
us. Basically Alut creates a single OpenAL context through Alc and sets it to 
current. On the Windows platform it initializes DirectSound. We also do an 
initial call to the error function to clear it. Every time we call 'glGetError' 
it will reset itself to 'AL_NO_ERROR'.</p>
<pre class=code>
<span class=codeComment>    <font color="#006600">// Load the wav data.</font></span>
    <span class=codeKeyword><font color="#0000FF">if</font></span> (loadALData() == AL.AL_FALSE)
        <span class=codeKeyword><font color="#0000FF">return</font></span> -1;

    setListenerValues();

    <span class=codeComment><font color="#006600">// Setup an exit procedure.</font></span>

	Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();
	runtime.addShutdownHook(
		<font color="#0000FF">new</font> Thread(
			<font color="#0000FF">new</font> Runnable() {
				<font color="#0000FF">public void</font> run() {
					killAllData();
				}
			}
		)
	);
</pre>
<p>We will check to see if the wav files loaded correctly. If not we must exit 
the program. Then we update the listener values, and finally we set our exit 
procedure.</p>
<pre class=code>	<font color="#0000FF">char</font>[] c = new <font color="#0000FF">char</font>[1];
	<font color="#0000FF">while</font>(c[0] != 'q') {	
		<font color="#0000FF">try</font> {
			BufferedReader buf =
					<font color="#0000FF">new</font> BufferedReader(<font color="#0000FF">new</font> InputStreamReader(System.in));
       	System.out.println(&quot;Press a key and hit ENTER: &quot; +
                               &quot;'p' to play, 's' to stop, 'h' to pause and 'q' to quit&quot;);
			buf.read(c);
			<font color="#0000FF">switch</font>(c[0]) {
				<font color="#0000FF">case</font> 'p':
					<font color="#006600">// Pressing 'p' will begin playing the sample.</font>
					al.alSourcePlay(source[0]);
					<font color="#0000FF">break</font>;
				<font color="#0000FF">case</font> 's':
					<font color="#006600">// Pressing 's' will stop the sample from playing.</font>
					alSourceStop(source[0]);
					<font color="#0000FF">break</font>;
				<font color="#0000FF">case</font> 'h':
					<font color="#006600">// Pressing 'n' will pause (hold) the sample.</font>
					alSourcePause(source[0]);
					<font color="#0000FF">break</font>;
			}
		} <font color="#0000FF">catch</font> (IOException e) {
			System.exit(1);
		}
	}
}

</pre>
<p>This is the interesting part of the tutorial. It's a very basic loop that 
lets us control the playback of the audio sample. Pressing 'p' will replay the 
sample, pressing 's' will stop the sample, and pressing 'h' will pause the 
sample. Pressing 'q' will exit the program.</p>
<p>Well there it is. Your first delve into OpenAL. I hope it was made simple 
enough for you. It may have been a little too simple for the 1337 h4X0r, but we 
all got to start somewhere. Things will get more advanced as we go along.</p>
